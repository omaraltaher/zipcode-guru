# zipcode-guru
Data visualization displaying data by ZIP code for different datasets. This version includes UFO sightings and IRS tax data. 
 
True to the spirit of oneness embodied in the guru, the site encourages interoperability between platforms and across versions. 

- The map functionality is achieved using Tableau. The ZIP code selection is pushed to the d3.js visualizations using Tableau's JavaScript API. 
- The UFO data visualization is made using d3.js version 4, and uses data from the National UFO Reporting Center http://www.nuforc.org/ .
- The IRS visuaization is made using d3.js version 3, and uses data from the Internal Revenue Service, https://www.irs.gov/uac/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-zip-code-data-soi
